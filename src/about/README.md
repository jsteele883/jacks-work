# About Me

I'm a web and email developer with a passion for well-thought out design and code. I love problem solving and creating simple solutions to complex problems.

I work for [knak](https://knak.com/). We build out technical solutions for email and landing page creation and have a great time doing it!

In my free time I love to Ski ⛷️, Mountain Bike 🚵, Run 🏃, Kayak 🛶 and generally explore 🏕️ in the Mountains near my home in Whistler BC ⛰️.

# About This Site

I created this site to keep a document of projects that I've worked on all in one place and so that I could write about any web related stuff as it comes to mind.

I do take on passion projects every once in a while so if you're interested in working with me feel free to get in touch!
