## Search and Filter Films

In October 2017 Whistler film festival were looking to increase their reach and ease of booking with a new system. They had experienced issues in the past with their website and were looking for a simpler faster system with a more modern design.

I designed, built and provided support for Whistler Film Festival in their website and booking engine revamp. The integrated booking site included search and filter functionality to help visitors easily find the films they wanted to see and then seamlessly book tickets with a modal that integrated with their booking engine.

### Result

The build enabled Whistler Film Festival employees to add new films simply via a custom Wordpress plugin. The films would then be available on the front end with trailers, synopsis and the ability for attendees to book online in a stylish responsive stylish site. This removed their previous dependence on a web developer to make changes and caused a large improvement in online ticket sales.

Here was a review in Pique News Magazine which cited a noticeable improvement in online bookings over the previous year.

> Total attendance over the festival's five days was 14,207, a two-per-cent increase from last year. That included 7,623 film-screening attendees and 2,448 special event attendees. There were an estimated 4,000-plus unique visitors.
>
> Ticket sales, meanwhile, increased 12 per cent compared to 2016, when issues with the festival's online ticketing software slowed sales.
