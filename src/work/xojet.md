## Xojet Landing Page Development

XOJET is the leading on-demand private aviation services platform in North America, offering their clients access to an extensive world-class fleet of private jets. As a premium brand specializing in exclusive, luxury service, XOJET wanted emails and landing pages that deliver the same high-end experience to their online audience.

XOJET had a brand new Marketo instance and had recently launched a new website, so they were looking for fresh, flexible, and creative designs that could be used across multiple campaigns.  We reviewed their previous HTML templates, listened to their feedback, and delivered a product that underscored their new design.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/work/xojet-email-1.png" alt="Xojet Email Template" style="width:600px;max-width:100%;"/></div>

The flexible email template provided Xojet marketers with a classy set of tools to send over to their recipients and leads.

The landing page template is perfectly aligned with the Xojet website to ensure brand consistency in style. I enjoyed working with their tasteful typography and subtle CSS animations when building out the template.

The result of the project? Bespoke creative that represents their first-class brand and a high-end user experience that matches the exclusive service they offer. Their high standards of service and clientele are matched with a classy booking well designed booking system.
