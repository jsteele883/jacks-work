## Presenting Crypto Data

I designed, built and hosted this ES6 Application as a freelance project. The app pulls data from a public API and maps the that data to the descriptions and images which are maintained by the client.

The user can then easily review some important info about each coin, sort by various metrics, search for new upcoming currencies and analyze their performance
