## Presenting Crypto Data

I designed, built and hosted this ES6 Application as a freelance project. The app pulls data from a public API and maps the that data to the descriptions and images which are maintained by the client.

The client wanted a simple way to maintain the descriptions of each coin so I was able to hook up a Google Sheet as a simple serverless database for him to manage content autonomously.

Visitors to the site can easily review some important info about each crypto currency, they can sort and filter by various metrics and search for new upcoming currencies and analyze their performance.

The most important feature for the client was to be able to rank the coins by market cap increase over the last 1 hour, 24 hours and 7 days in order to keep track of and update their portfolio's.
